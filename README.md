## Design Reasoning

The app was initialised completely from scratch in order to ensure a smooth integration between React - Next - Redux RTK - TailwindCSS.

It retrives the data from a dedicated [JSON SERVER API](https://github.com/edisonabdiel/RomeoTaskDB) and displays it in cohesive manner.

Integrates a simple yet efficient search feature that allows the user to search for users by name and update the list in real time.

Components were built in a fashion that allows for a more responsive, dynamic and scalable experience.

The UI is meant to be minimalistic yet engaging and intuitive. It was built using TailwindCSS to allow great control and autonomy over the layout of the app and also the design/feel of all the elements within it.

Users are fictional and used for demo porpuses only.
